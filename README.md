# Citi Bike - NYC Bike Sharing

## Overview 
Citi Bike has met a lot of success in New York City, and I have been tasked with creating a pitch to investors to expand Citi Bike to Des Moines, Iowa. This pitch consists of a collection of graphs, visualizing NYC Citi Bike, the components of its success, and the elements that would translate well to Des Moines.

## Resources
- CitiBike [public data for August 2019](https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html)
- Tableau Public

## Results
This pitch to investors can be [found here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/rachael4817/viz/CitiBikeSuccessinNYC/CitiBikeStory?publish=yes). Analyses include a breakdown of Citi Bike's customers, the top starting and ending trip locations, peak usage days and times, and average trip durations.

## Summary
Citi Bike's core customer base at this time is males, people in their 30s, and are subscribers of Citi Bank. Peak usage is typically weekends, and roughly 8am and 5-7pm. If Des Moines has a population that matches this demographic and street traffic trends, CitiBike has a strong potential for success. Citi Bike's Des Moines success can be better predicted by analyzing typical street traffic trends, as well as the population's willingness to spend on Citi Bike - ideally broken down by demographic information. Furthermore, a deeper analysis of Citi Bike NYC's revenue, expenses, and profit per geographic area, time frame, and user demographic.
